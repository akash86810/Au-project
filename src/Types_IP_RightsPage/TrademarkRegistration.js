        <h2 id="what-is-trademark">What is Trademark Registration?</h2>
        <p>
          A Company Name or a Brand name is to be registered before the
          Registrar of Trademarks. A trademark registration gives exclusive
          ownership over the brand name to the owner of the mark to use the
          same. This means that no third party can use the said mark without the
          permission of the registered proprietor. Furthermore, this
          registration grants the registered owner a right to use any third
          party before a court of law against misuse of the registered
          trademark.
        </p>
