        <h2 id="what-is-copyright">What is Copyright Registration?</h2>
        <p>
          Copyright is named as Creator's right. Copyright is a special right
          given to the creator of original work for a stipulated period of time.
          Everything that is created through the human intellectual brain is
          named copyright. The most advantages of copyright are that you can
          earn money through your copyrights smartly by way of assigning or
          licensing the rights to others.
        </p>

        <h2 id="who-can-apply">Who Can Apply for Copyright Registration?</h2>
        <p>
          The person invents some product on his own, and they claim the
          copyright for his product. Even small inventions can obtain copyright
          registration. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Logos</li>
          <li>Dramatic work</li>
          <li>Photographs</li>
          <li>Motion pictures</li>
          <li>Computer programs</li>
          <li>Literary work</li>
          <li>Artistic work</li>
          <li>Cinematography</li>
          <li>Sound recordings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="documents">Documents for Copyright Registration</h2>

          <li>Two photos of the work</li>
          <li>Draft</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are the basic required documents for copyright registration and
          the documents vary based on their inventions.
        </p>

          <li>Examination</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there is no objection, the form moves to registration.</p>

          <li>
