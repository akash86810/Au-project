        <p>
          This type of entity was formed by combining the benefits of a
          Partnership firm and a Private Limited Company. The Union Government
          introduced LLP in the year of 2008 by way of the Limited Liability
          Partnership Act, of 2009. LLP was introduced to provide a form of
          business that is easy to maintain and to help owners by providing them
          with limited liability. With a minimum of two partners, an LLP can be
          formed. Further, all the rights and duties concerning the designated
          partners are governed and administered by the LLP Agreement.
