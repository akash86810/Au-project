            There is no specific registration for a Proprietorship firm because
            there is no specific act established to regulate the proprietorship
            firm.
          </li>
          <li>
            So we can utilize UDYAM Registration as proof of the existence of
            the business. We can use this Udyam Registration as proof for
            opening a current account in a Bank in the name of our company.
          </li>
          <li>
